# lish
### a language that nobody really needs

Not even joking. I don't need this shit, I just like to have it around.

## install

I think there's a `Makefile` or something.

Maybe try:
	make

## usage

Oh boy, here we go... Well, you can just type `lish` to start the repl.
Just fuck around with it, 'cause I have no docs yet.
